# CV-DL-Project
My project for the computer vision and deep learning class at NTNU. Made an object detector. FPN backbone, focal loss and deeper convolutional nets from the RetinaNet paper was implemented. I also implemented data augmentation, specific adaptation to the dataset (after qualitative and quantitative analysis). Lastly I transfer learned a detectron2 object detector to the dataset given for the project.
